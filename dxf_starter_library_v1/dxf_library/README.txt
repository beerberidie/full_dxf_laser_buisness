DXF Starter Library (R12) — Generated by ChatGPT
Units: millimeters (assumed). Thicknesses noted in filenames/titles for reference; DXF is planar.
Layers:
- OUTLINE (7) — outer profiles
- HOLES (1) — cut-outs, holes
- CENTERLINES (3) — center marks/crosses
- NOTES (2) — minimal text titles

Notes:
- Flanges/manholes use generic bolt circles. Confirm standard (PN/ANSI) before production.
- Some items approximate slots with round holes; replace with true slots if required.
- Radius corners are drawn square in some templates; apply fillets in CAD if needed.
- Always validate against customer drawings before cutting.
