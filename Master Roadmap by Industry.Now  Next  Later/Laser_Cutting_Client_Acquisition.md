> Subject: Reliable Supply of Laser-Cut Mining Components  
> Dear [Name],  
> We supply mining support companies with precision laser-cut screen plates, liners, and conveyor brackets on a repeat basis. By outsourcing cutting to us, you avoid downtime and stock-outs. We can set up a recurring monthly delivery of your standard wear parts.  
> Could we schedule a short call this week to discuss which items you currently outsource?

1. **Select industries** to focus on (start with 2–3).
2. **Shortlist 10 companies** in each.

4. **Follow up** via LinkedIn and phone within 48 hours.
5. **Offer sample part** as entry.
6. **Convert first order** → lock into monthly/weekly standing supply.
7. **Track leads & conversions** in a CRM sheet (company, contact, part, quote, outcome).

## 5. Next Steps

- Build a simple **marketing flyer/pack** showing parts you can cut.
